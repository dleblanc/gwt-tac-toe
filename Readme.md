A simple Tic Tac Toe game written in GWT - mainly as an example of modern GWT MVP approaches, Gin+Guice injection, Declarative UI's and styles, Testing with JUnit 4 and Mockito, etc.

The maven integration isn't 100%, but it's enough to work standalone and in Eclipse.

I've left the Eclipse files in there so it can be imported quickly - I'm working with M2E, but in theory mvn eclipse:eclipse should work too.
